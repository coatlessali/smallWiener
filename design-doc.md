yes we're sticking with this

## Game Mechanics
SW will have quite a few delicious gameplay mechanics. The goal is to make a very fluid combat exploration experience.

### Overview
SW is planned to be a 2D Sidescrolling Metroidvania with a deep and intricate combat system that aims to be intuitive without being limiting. The idea is to maximize the distance between the skill ceiling and the skill floor, without compromising on either.

### CONTROLS

The essential control scheme is limited to the PS1 standard controller (not the DualShock), while trying to *aim* to be playable on a SNES/SFC controller. This limitation has a few reasons:
* Hardware Accessibility - Making sure this game is comfortably playable on as many input devices as possible.
* Gameplay Accessibility - Smartly allocating buttons to actions in an intuitive way and simplifying mechanics from two buttons to one button where pheasible.
* Limiting Feature Creep - If you gave me analog sticks, this project would never be finished.

(NOTE: If we can add Native GameCube Controller support later that would be epico tipico.)

For the sake of avoiding confusion, we will be using the PlayStation button names, as Microsoft and Nintendo can't agree on whether or not A is on right or bottom, so Sony took LSD instead.

(NOTE: Add the ability to swap Cross or Circle as confirm in menus pls.)

| Button       | Result                                                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Up           | Look Up / Angle Attacks Upward / Climb Ladders / Enter Rooms (?) |
| Down         | Crouch / Slide / Drop Through Platforms / Fast Fall              |
| Left / Right | Run                                                              |
| Cross        | Jump / Recover / Walljump                                        |
| Square       | Attack / Recover / Parry (Press Forward)                         |
| Triangle     | Special Action / Grab / Grappling Hook (?)                       |
| Circle       | Interact                                                         |
| R1           | Lock Onto Opponent                                               |
| L1           | Time Cancel (Cancels any attack on hit, and any other anim.)     |

While Locked On:

* ! = Does nothing

| Button       | Result                                                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Down         | Crouch                                                           |
| Left / Right | Walk / Run (Double Tap)                                          |
| Cross        | Dodge (Hold Forward) / Backflip (Hold Back) / Jump               |

While In Air:

* ! = Does Nothing

| Button       | Result                                                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Down         | Fast Fall / Angle Attack Downwards                               |
| Cross        | Double Jump (IF UNLOCKED)                                        |
| Square       | Attack / Parry (IF UNLOCKED)                                     |

(TODO: Simplify these mechanical ideas.)
